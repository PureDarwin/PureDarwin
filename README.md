Darwin is the Open Source operating system from Apple that forms the basis for Mac OS X and PureDarwin. PureDarwin is a community project that aims to make Darwin more usable (some people think of it as the informal successor to OpenDarwin).

One current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO/VM of Darwin 10.x
