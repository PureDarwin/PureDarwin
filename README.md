PureDarwin, moved from https://code.google.com/p/puredarwin/

Darwin is the Open Source operating system from Apple that forms the basis for Mac OS X, and PureDarwin is a community project to make Darwin more usable (some people think of it as the informal successor to OpenDarwin).

One current goal of this project is to provide a useful bootable ISO of Darwin 10.x and Darwin 9.x.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin/wiki) for more information.
