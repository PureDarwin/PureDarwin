// This is the only C file compiled into Libsystem when building for i386.
// We use EXCLUDED_ and INCLUDED_SOURCE_FILES in the xcconfig to accomplish
// this.
//
// i386 is no longer a supported architecture for macOS. The kernel doesnâ€™t run
// i386 macOS executables. However, we cannot completely remove the i386
// slice from libSystem.B.dylib. In order to support the watchOS Simulator,
// macOS includes several libraries with i386 slices. The watchOS Simulator
// uses the i386 ISA with a different  Mach-O platform and its own entire set
// of system libraries. Some of those libraries (including those from the clang/
// llvm project) verify that the compiler works by compiling and linking a
// simple executable. That would fail if Libsystem lacked an i386 slice.
// So, we will preserve a vestigial i386 slice, but no executables can actually
// use it to run.
