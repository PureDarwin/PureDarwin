/*	These definitions and the implementations of nanf, nan, and nanl rely on:

		The C 1999 standard, ISO/IEC 9899:1999(E), Programming Languages--C.

		IEEE Std 754-1985, IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic.
		(Later designated IEC 60559 and IEC 559.)

		GCC behavior:

			__BIG_ENDIAN__ is defined iff the most significant bytes of an
			object appear at lower addresses.

			Data may be written to one member of a union and read with a new
			interpretation from another member.

			In the run-time character set, the digits 0 through 9 must be
			consecutive characters, the letters A through F must be consecutive
			characters, and the letters a through f must be consecutive
			characters.

			__POWERPC__ and __i386__ are defined when compiling for the
			corresponding architectures.

			__LONG_DOUBLE_128__ is defined iff long double is implemented as
			pair of doubles.

		PowerPC and Intel IA-32 architecture:

			The floating-point format, including that the most significant bit
			of the significand of a NaN is true iff the NaN is quiet.

				Motorola (later separated into Freescale), Programming
				Environments Manual for 32-Bit Implementations of the PowerPC

/*	Define the type LongDouble to access the representation of a long double.

	This has some complications.  On a PowerPC, a long double is implemented
	either as two doubles (with -mlong-double-128, the default) or as a single
	double (with -mlong-double-64, provided primarily for Unix 2003
	compliance).  In a long double NaN, the value of the second double, if
	present, is ignored.  Only the significand of the first double is used.

	On IA-32, a long double has a different format, with an explicit integer
	bit in the significand.

	We mostly handle these differences in this type definition.  The nanl code
	has some additional code that is conditional on the differences.

	It is probably overkill to provide both big- and little-endian definitions
	for each of PowerPC and IA-32, but it does not hurt to be prepared.
