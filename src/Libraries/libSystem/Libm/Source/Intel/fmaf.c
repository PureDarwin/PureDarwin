// float fmaf(float a, float b, float c)
//
// The fmaf function returns a*b + c computed without intermediate rounding, and
// sets the flags appropriately.  IEEE-754 leaves undefined whether or not an
// implementation should set the invalid flag for fmaf(0,inf,NaN).  We choose
// not to do so in this implementation.
//
// This implementation is intended to be fully IEEE-754 compliant.  It is
// designed to produce the correctly rounded result in all rounding modes,
// and sets all flags appropriately.  It is intended to be relatively easily
// ported across architectures and compilers; the one issue to be aware of
// is the use of a union for type-punning double and uint64_t.  Some compilers
// will produce incorrect codegen for this due to overambitious type-based
// aliasing optimizations.  Make sure to check the generated code with your
// compiler.
