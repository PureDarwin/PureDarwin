 *  This set of functions may seem a little silly at first. The compiler can generate
 *  sqrtsd or sqrtsf inline, so why do we need a function? It appears that people can 
 *  make a function pointer to sqrt and call that. Therefore an implementation of sqrt()
 *  should probably exist. We define a trivial one here.
