.\#  NAME
.SH NAME
otool-classic \- object file displaying tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B otool
[
.I "option \&..."
] [
.I "file \&..."
]
.\#  DESCRIPTION
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I otool-classic
command displays specified parts of object files or libraries. It is now largely
obsolete and the command line shim,
.IR otool (1)
executes
.IR llvm-obdump (1)
as the default tool.
.I otool-classic
is still useful for diagnosing bad, corrupted, or fuzzed binaries, or for
viewing older binaries that
.I llvm-objdump
will not read.
.PP
If the
.B \-m
option is not used the file
arguments may be of the form
.IR "libx.a(foo.o)" ,
to request information about only that object file and not
the entire library.   (Typically this argument must be quoted,
.I ``libx.a(foo.o)'',
to get it past the shell.)
.I  Otool-classic
understands both Mach-O (Mach object) files and universal file formats.
.I  Otool-classic
can display the specified information in either its raw (numeric) form
(without the
.B \-v
flag), or in a symbolic form using macro names of constants, etc. (with the
.B \-v
or
.B \-V
flag).
.PP
At least one of the following options must be specified:
.TP
.B \-a
Display the archive header, if the file is an archive.
.TP
.B \-S
Display the contents of the `\_\^\_.SYMDEF' file, if the file is an archive.
.TP
.B \-f
Display the universal headers.
.TP
.B \-h
Display the Mach header.
.TP
.B \-l
Display the load commands.
.TP
.B \-L
Display the names and version numbers of the shared libraries that the object
file uses, as well as the shared library ID if the file is a shared library.
.TP
.B \-D
Display just the install name of a shared library.  See
.IR install_name_tool (1)
for more info.
.TP
.BI \-s " segname sectname"
Display the contents of the section
.RI ( segname,sectname ).
If the
.B \-v
flag is specified, the section is displayed as its type, unless the type is
zero (the section header flags).  Also the sections
(\_\^\_OBJC,\_\^\_protocol),
(\_\^\_OBJC,__string_object) and (\_\^\_OBJC,\_\^\_runtime_setup) are displayed
symbolically if the
.B \-v
flag is specified. For unknown section types, if the
.B \-V
flag is specified, the contents of the section are displayed in a canonical
hex+ASCII display, where a column of hexadecimal values print along side a
column of ASCII characters.
.TP
.B \-t
Display the contents of the (\_\^\_TEXT,\_\^\_text) section.  With the
.B \-v
flag, this disassembles the text.  With the
.B \-V
flag, it also symbolically disassembles the operands.
.TP
.B \-x
Display the contents of every \_\^\_text section found in the file. This is
useful when looking at the Mach kernel and other files with \_\^\_text sections
in more than one segment, or where the \_\^\_text section is somewhere other
than \_\^\_TEXT. When used with the
.B \-v
flag, this disassembles the text. When used with the
.B \-V
flag, it also symbolically disassembles the operands.
.TP
.B \-d
Display the contents of the (\_\^\_DATA,\_\^\_data) section.
.TP
.B \-o
Display the contents of the \_\^\_OBJC segment used by the Objective-C run-time
system.
.TP
.B \-r
Display the relocation entries.
.TP
.B \-c
Display the argument strings (argv[] and envp[]) from a core file.
.TP
.B \-I
Display the indirect symbol table.
.TP
.B \-T
Display the table of contents for a dynamically linked shared library.
.TP
.B \-R
Display the reference table of a dynamically linked shared library.
.TP
.B \-M
Display the module table of a dynamically linked shared library.
.TP
.B \-H
Display the two-level namespace hints table.
.TP
.B \-G
Display the data in code table.
.TP
.B \-C
Display the linker optimization hints (-v for verbose mode can also be added).
.TP
.B \-P
Print the info plist section, (\_\^\_TEXT,\_\^\_info\_plist), as strings.
.PP
The following options may also be given:
.TP
.BI "\-p " name
Used with the
.B \-t
and
.B \-v
or
.B \-V
options to start the disassembly from symbol
.I name
and continue to the end of the (\_\^\_TEXT,\_\^\_text) section. This option
can also be used with the
.B \-x
option to begin disassembly from symbol
.I name
in any segment where a \_\^\_text section is found.
.TP
.B \-v
Display verbosely (symbolically) when possible.
.TP
.B \-V
Display the disassembled operands symbolically (this implies the
.B \-v
option).  This is useful with the
.B \-s,
.B \-t,
and
.B \-x
options.
.TP
.B \-X
Don't print leading addresses or headers with disassembly of sections.
.TP
.B \-q
Use the llvm disassembler when doing disassembly; this is available for the x86
and arm architectures.  This is the default.
.TP
.BI \-mcpu= arg
When doing disassembly using the llvm disassembler use the cpu
.I arg.
.TP
.B \-function_offsets
When doing disassembly print the decimal offset from the last label printed.
.TP
.B \-j
When doing disassembly print the opcode bytes of the instructions.
.TP
.B \-Q
Use
.IR otool-classic (1)'s
disassembler when doing disassembly.
.TP
.BI \-arch " arch_type"
Specifies the architecture,
.I arch_type,
of the file for
.IR otool-classic (1)
to operate on when the file is a universal file (aka a file with multiple
architectures).  (See
.IR arch (3)
for the currently known
.IR arch_type s.)
The
.I arch_type
can be "all" to operate on all architectures in the file.
The default is to display only the host architecture, if the file contains it;
otherwise, all architectures in the file are shown.
.TP
.B \-m
The object file names are not assumed to be in the archive(member) syntax,
which allows file names containing parenthesis.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the
.IR otool-classic (1)
version information.
