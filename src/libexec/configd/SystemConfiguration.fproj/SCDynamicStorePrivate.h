	@header SCDynamicStorePrivate
	@discussion The SCDynamicStore APIs provide access to a key-value
		dictionary maintained by a server process.  The dictionary is
		accessible by all processes on the system.  The APIs allow you
		to list the current key-value pairs, add or remove key-value
		pairs, add or change the values associated with a key, and
		request change notifications.

		The SCDynamicStore is not "persistent" (the store content
		starts off empty and is not saved across boot).

		All interaction with the SCDynamicStore [server] is via Mach
		IPC (MiG) messages.

		A client process, using the SCDynamicStoreSetNotificationKeys
		API, specifies a list of specific keys of interest and/or a
		list of regex(3) pattern strings that will be matched on
		current (and future) keys in the store.  Any matched keys that
		are added, updated, or removed will trigger a notification.
		The notification is delivered to the monitoring session via
		a "something has changed" Mach IPC message.  The callback
		notification, as part of its implementation, issues a request
		to the server to identify the specific list of changes and
		this list is passed along as part of the callback.  Any
		subsequent changes to the SCDynamicStore will trigger a new
		"something has changed" Mach IPC message and an additional
		callback.

		Note: the list (array) of changed keys passed to the
		      notification callback will be always be non-NULL
		      and non-empty with one exception.  That exception
		      is when the SCDynamicStore server has been restarted.
		      In that case, if no reconnect callback was setup
		      with the SCDynamicStoreSetDisconnectCallBack API
		      then a non-NULL but empty array will be passed.

		Disconnect/reconnect considerations:

		1. We don't expect the SCDynamicStore server to fail but one
		   should always be prepared for the unexpected.

		2. Processes that write to the SCDynamicStore should be
		   prepared to repost any content when/if the server fails.
		   A callout, registered with the SCDynamicStoreSetDisconnectCallBack
		   API, should be used to post any updates the SCDynamicStore
		   after a failure.

		3. Processes that cache SCDynamicStore content (or otherwise
		   maintain state based on previous notifications) should be
		   aware that all store content is lost when/if the server
		   fails.  After handling a SCDynamicStore notification with
		   no keys or a disconnect/reconnect callout, your code should
		   assume that any cached content is no longer valid.

		Performance considerations:

		1. We recommend that any code trying to capture a snapshot of
		   more than one SCDynamicStore key should use the SCDynamicStoreCopyMultiple
		   API (and not make multiple calls to SCDynamicStoreCopyValue).

		2. We recommend that any code making multiple (and related)
		   changes to the SCDynamicStore should batch them into a
		   single call using the SCDynamicStoreSetMultiple API (and
		   not make multiple calls to SCDynamicStoreSetValue).
