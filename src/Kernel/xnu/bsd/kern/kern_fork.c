 * fork1
 *
 * Description:	common code used by all new process creation other than the
 *		bootstrap of the initial process on the system
 *
 * Parameters: parent_proc		parent process of the process being
 *		child_threadp		pointer to location to receive the
 *					Mach thread_t of the child process
 *					created
 *		kind			kind of creation being requested
 *		coalitions		if spawn, the set of coalitions the
 *					child process should join, or NULL to
 *					inherit the parent's. On non-spawns,
 *					this param is ignored and the child
 *					always inherits the parent's
 *					coalitions.
 *
 * Notes:	Permissable values for 'kind':
 *
 *		PROC_CREATE_FORK	Create a complete process which will
 *					return actively running in both the
 *					parent and the child; the child copies
 *					the parent address space.
 *		PROC_CREATE_SPAWN	Create a complete process which will
 *					return actively running in the parent
 *					only after returning actively running
 *					in the child; the child address space
 *					is newly created by an image activator,
 *					after which the child is run.
 *
 *		At first it may seem strange that we return the child thread
 *		address rather than process structure, since the process is
 *		the only part guaranteed to be "new"; however, since we do
 *		not actualy adjust other references between Mach and BSD, this
 *		is the only method which guarantees us the ability to get
 *		back to the other information.

 * Notes:	Attempts to create a new child process which inherits state

 *		is initially suspended.  Until we resume the child process,

 *
 *		The return information to the child is contained in the

 *		become visible to the child through a normal return process,
 *		since it never made the call into the kernel itself in the
 *		first place.
 *
 *		After resuming the thread, this function returns directly to
 *		the parent process which invoked the fork() system call.
 *
 * Important:	The child thread_resume occurs before the parent returns;
 *		depending on scheduling latency, this means that it is not
 *		deterministic as to whether the parent or child is scheduled
 *		to run first.  It is entirely possible that the child could
 *		run to completion prior to the parent running.
