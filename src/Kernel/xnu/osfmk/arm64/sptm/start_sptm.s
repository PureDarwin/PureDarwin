/**
 * XNU entry point.
 *
 * The SPTM jumps here as part of both the cold and warm boot paths, for all
 * CPUs. This entry point is also jumped to when the SPTM wants to trigger the
 * XNU panic path.
 *
 * @param x0 Sentinel value describing why we jumped to this entry point:
 *           SPTM_CPU_BOOT_COLD: Cold boot path.
 *           SPTM_CPU_BOOT_WARM: Warm boot path.
 *           SPTM_CPU_BOOT_SECONDARY: Secondary CPU boot path.
 *           SPTM_CPU_BOOT_HIB: Hibernation exit path.
 *           SPTM_CPU_PANIC: A panic condition was triggered in SPTM/TXM/cL4.
 *
 * The possible values of the rest of the argument registers are dependent on
 * the sentinel value in x0.
 *
 * If x0 is SPTM_CPU_PANIC:
 * @param x1 A pointer to the panic string.
 * @param x2 A boolean defining whether XNU should attempt a local coredump or
 *           not. If this is false, then the SPTM is in a state that trying to
 *           generate a coredump will most likely trigger more panics (seeing as
 *           the NVMe driver will need to call into the SPTM).
 *
 * Otherwise:
 * @param x1 iBoot boot arguments.
 * @param x2 SPTM boot arguments.
 *
 * @note The SPTM initially only maps the __TEXT_BOOT_EXEC segment
 *       as RX, and does not remap the rest of the code as RX until
 *       after the XNU fixups phase has been completed. Since this
 *       is the entry point, it must be made executable from the
 *       very start.
