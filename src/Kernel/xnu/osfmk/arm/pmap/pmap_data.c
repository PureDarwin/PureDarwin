 *
 * @param pa Output parameter to store the physical address of the allocated
 *           page if one was able to be allocated (NULL otherwise).
 * @param size The amount of memory to allocate. This has to be PAGE_SIZE on
 *             PPL-enabled systems. On other systems it can be either PAGE_SIZE
 *             or 2*PAGE_SIZE, in which case the two pages are allocated
 *             physically contiguous.
 * @param options The following options can be specified:
 *     - PMAP_PAGES_ALLOCATE_NOWAIT: If the VM or PPL page free list don't have
 *       any free pages available then don't wait for one, just return
 *       immediately without allocating a page. PPL-enabled systems must ALWAYS
 *       pass this flag since allocating memory from within the PPL can't spin
 *       or block due to preemption being disabled (would be a perf hit).
 *
 *     - PMAP_PAGE_RECLAIM_NOWAIT: If memory failed to get allocated the normal
 *       way (either by the PPL page free list on PPL-enabled systems, or
 *       through the VM on other systems), then fall back to attempting to
 *       reclaim a userspace page table. This should only be specified in paths
 *       that absolutely can't take the latency hit of waiting for the VM or
 *       jumping out of the PPL to allocate more pages.
 *
 * @return KERN_SUCCESS if a page was successfully allocated, or
 *         KERN_RESOURCE_SHORTAGE if a page failed to get allocated. This can
 *         also be returned on non-PPL devices if preemption is disabled after
 *         early boot since allocating memory from the VM requires grabbing a
 *         mutex.
