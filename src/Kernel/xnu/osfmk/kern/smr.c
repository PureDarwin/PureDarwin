#pragma mark - SMR domains

/*
 * This SMR scheme is directly FreeBSD's "Global Unbounded Sequences".
 *
 * Major differences are:
 *
 * - only eager clocks are implemented (no lazy, no implicit)
 *
 *
 * SMR clocks have 3 state machines interacting at any given time:
 *
 * 1. reader critical sections
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Each CPU can disable preemption and do this sequence:
 *
 *     CPU::c_rd_seq = GLOBAL::c_wr_seq;
 *
 *     < unfortunate place to receive a long IRQ >                      [I]
 *
 *     os_atomic_thread_fence(seq_cst);                                 [R1]
 *
 *     {
 *         // critical section
 *     }
 *
 *     os_atomic_store(&CPU::c_rd_seq, INVALID, release);               [R2]
 *
 *
 *
 * 2. writer sequence advances
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Each writer can increment the global write sequence
 * at any given time:
 *
 *    os_atomic_add(&GLOBAL::c_wr_seq, SMR_SEQ_INC, release);           [W]
 *
 *
 *
 * 3. synchronization sequence: poll/wait/scan
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * This state machine synchronizes with the other two in order to decide
 * if a given "goal" is in the past. Only the cases when the call
 * is successful is interresting for barrier purposes, and we will focus
 * on cases that do not take an early return for failures.
 *
 * a. __smr_poll:
 *
 *     rd_seq = os_atomic_load(&GLOBAL::c_rd_seq, acquire);             [S1]
 *     if (goal < rd_seq) SUCCESS.
 *     wr_seq = os_atomic_load(&GLOBAL::c_rd_seq, relaxed);
 *
 * b. __smr_scan
 *
 *     os_atomic_thread_fence(seq_cst)                                  [S2]
 *
 *     observe the minimum CPU::c_rd_seq "min_rd_seq"
 *     value possible or rw_seq if no CPU was in a critical section.
 *     (possibly spinning until it satisfies "goal")
 *
 * c. __smr_rd_advance
 *
 *     cur_rd_seq = load_exclusive(&GLOBAL::c_rd_seq);
 *     os_atomic_thread_fence(seq_cst);                                 [S3]
 *     if (min_rd_seq > cur_rd_seq) {
 *         store_exlusive(&GLOBAL::c_rd_seq, min_rd_seq);
 *     }
 *
 *
 * One sentence summary
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * A simplistic one-sentence summary of the algorithm is that __smr_scan()
 * works really hard to insert itself in the timeline of write sequences and
 * observe a reasonnable bound for first safe-to-reclaim sequence, and
 * issues [S3] to sequence everything around "c_rd_seq" (via [S3] -> [S1]):
 *
 *              GLOBAL::c_rd_seq                GLOBAL::c_wr_seq
 *                             v                v
 *       ──────────────────────┬────────────────┬─────────────────────
 *       ... safe to reclaim   │    deferred    │   future         ...
 *       ──────────────────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────────
 *
 *
 * Detailed explanation
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * [W] -> [R1] establishes a "happens before" relationship between a given
 * writer and this critical section. The loaded GLOBAL::c_wr_seq might
 * however be stale with respect to the one [R1] really synchronizes with
 * (see [I] explanation below).
 *
 *
 * [R1] -> [S2] establishes a "happens before" relationship between all the
 * active critical sections and the scanner.
 * It lets us compute the oldest possible sequence pinned by an active
 * critical section.
 *
 *
 * [R2] -> [S3] establishes a "happens before" relationship between all the
 * inactive critical sections and the scanner.
 *
 *
 * [S3] -> [S1] is the typical expected fastpath: when the caller can decide
 * that its goal is older than the last update an __smr_rd_advance() did.
 * Note that [S3] doubles as an "[S1]" when two __smr_scan() race each other
 * and one of them finishes last but observed a "worse" read sequence.
 *
 *
 * [W], [S3] -> [S1] is the last crucial property: all updates to the global
 * clock are totally ordered because they update the entire 128bit state
 * every time with an RMW. This guarantees that __smr_poll() can't load
 * an `rd_seq` that is younger than the `wr_seq` it loads next.
 *
 *
 * [I] __smr_enter() also can be unfortunately delayed after observing
 * a given write sequence and right before [R1] at [I].
 *
 * However for a read sequence to have move past what __smr_enter() observed,
 * it means another __smr_scan() didn't observe the store to CPU::c_rd_seq
 * made by __smr_enter() and thought the section was inactive.
 *
 * This can only happen if the scan's [S2] was issued before the delayed
 * __smr_enter() [R1] (during the [I] window).
 *
 * As a consequence the outcome of that scan can be accepted as the "real"
 * write sequence __smr_enter() should have observed.
 *
 *
 * Litmus tests
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * This is the proof of [W] -> [R1] -> [S2] being established properly:
 * - P0 sets a global and calls smr_synchronize()
 * - P1 does smr_enter() and loads the global
 *
 *     AArch64 MP
 *     {
 *         global = 0;
 *         wr_seq = 123;
 *         p1_rd_seq = 0;
 *
 *         0:x0 = global; 0:x1 = wr_seq; 0:x2 = p1_rd_seq;
 *         1:x0 = global; 1:x1 = wr_seq; 1:x2 = p1_rd_seq;
 *     }
 *      P0                     | P1                         ;
 *      MOV      X8, #2        | LDR        X8, [X1]        ;
 *      STR      X8, [X0]      | STR        X8, [X2]        ;
 *      LDADDL   X8, X9, [X1]  | DMB        SY              ;
 *      DMB      SY            | LDR        X10, [X0]       ;
 *      LDR      X10, [X2]     |                            ;
 *     exists (0:X10 = 0 /\ 1:X8 = 123 /\ 1:X10 = 0)
 *
 *
 * This is the proof that deferred advances are also correct:
 * - P0 sets a global and does a smr_deferred_advance()
 * - P1 does an smr_synchronize() and reads the global
 *
 *     AArch64 MP
 *     {
 *         global = 0;
 *         wr_seq = 123;
 *
 *         0:x0 = global; 0:x1 = wr_seq; 0:x2 = 2;
 *         1:x0 = global; 1:x1 = wr_seq; 1:x2 = 2;
 *     }
 *      P0                     | P1                         ;
 *      STR      X2, [X0]      | LDADDL     X2, X9, [X1]    ;
 *      DMB      SY            | DMB        SY              ;
 *      LDR      X9, [X1]      | LDR        X10, [X0]       ;
 *      ADD      X9, X9, X2    |                            ;
 *     exists (0:X9 = 125 /\ 1:X9 = 123 /\ 1:X10 = 0)
