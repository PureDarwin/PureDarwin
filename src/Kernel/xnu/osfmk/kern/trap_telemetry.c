 * Convert an array of backtrace addresses in FRAMES into an offset backtrace

 * This backtrace scheme has records deliminated by newline characters. Each

 * identified by the presence of an `@` character in the record. Any other
 * record is a UUID entry.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * 14760@0\n
 * 2B417DFA-7964-3EBF-97EE-FC94D26FFABD\n
 * 9f18@1\n
 * F9EFB7CA-8F23-3990-8E57-A7DAD698D494\n
 * 87c974@2\n
 * 8686ED81-CAA9-358D-B162-1F2F97334C65\n
 * 87cce4@2\n
 * 874f64@2\n
 *
 * Structurally, this example is equivalent to:
 *
 * <text offset>@<uuid entry idx=0>\n
 * <uuid entry 0>\n
 * <text offset>@<uuid entry idx=1>\n
 * <uuid entry 1>\n
 * <text offset>@<uuid entry idx=2>\n
 * <uuid entry 2>\n
 * <text offset>@<uuid entry idx=2>\n
 * <text offset>@<uuid entry idx=2>\n
 *
 * The first record here is a backtrace entry. Backtrace entries encode program
 * location as a hex offset into the __TEXT/__TEXT_EXEC segment of the enclosing
 * binary. The enclosing binary is identified by a hex encoded, zero-indexed
 * UUID entry ID which follows after the `@` in a backtrace entry.
 *
 * The second record is a UUID entry. UUID entries are simply records which
 * contain nothing but the UUID. UUID entries are implicitly assigned IDs,
 * starting from zero, in the order they appear in the record stream. Entries
 * may be referenced before they are used.
 *
 * Given a 256 byte buffer, we can fit up to ten backtrace entries (assuming
 * each binary is no larger than 256MB and we have no more than four unique
 * UUIDs in the backtrace).
 *
 * If the encoder runs out of space (for example, because we have more than four
 * unique UUIDs), the later records will truncate abruptly. In order to provide
 * as much information as possible, UUIDs are encoded immediately after they are
 * used. This means that if the encoder does run out of space, all backtrace
