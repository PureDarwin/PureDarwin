 * @macro WAITQ_TYPED_EVENT64
 *
 * @brief
 * Macro to form a "typed" event from a kernel pointer.
 *
 * @discussion
 * The waitq subsystem uses "events" to perform wakeups that tend to be kernel
 * pointers. Some subsystems do not tolerate spurious wakeups but some
 * subsystems might perform wakeup on "freed" pointers which could cause such
 * spurious wakeups.
 *
 * This macros allows to create events that are "typed" so that spurious wakeups
 * caused by a given subsystem can't cause spurious wakeups in subsystems that
 * expect precise wakeups.
 *
 * Default events behave like WAITQ_TYPED_EVENT(kThreadWaitNone, ...) and aren't
 * allowed to perform spurious wakeups.
 *
 *
 * This allows for primitive that track existence of waiters into some storage
 * to performance wakeups and maintain these bits even when not being able to
 * reason with the lifecycle of the underlying storage.
 *
 * If a thread can be pulled from the wait queue for a given typed event
 * (using @c waitq_wakeup64_identify()), until that thread is resumed
 * (with @c waitq_resume_identified_thread()), then it is safe to mutate
 * the backing store of the primitive, because the caller borrows it from the
 * thread it pulled from the wait queue.
 *
 * The downside of this trick is that the wake up can be spurious and affect
 * a "future" instance of the synchronization primitive that happens to have
 * been reallocated, and as a result, the underlying primitive must be resilient
 * to spurious wakeups. The current client of this technology is XNU's modern
 * reader-writer lock.
 *
 * Events used for typed events are expected to be either small integers,
 * or valid kernel pointers, for which the [48:55] bits are either 0x00
 * or 0xff.
 *
 * Note: MTE systems however make this race even less likely given that a reused
 *       primitive would likely use a different MTE tag and as a result
 *       a different event.
