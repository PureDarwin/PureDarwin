 * @brief
 * Creates an empty VM map.
 *
 * @discussion
 * A VM map represents an address space or sub-address space that is managed
 * by the Mach VM.
 *
 * It consists of a complex data structure which represents all the VM regions
 * as configured by the address space client, which supports fast lookup
 * by address or range.
 *
 * In the Mach VM, the VM map is the source of truth for all the configuration
 * of regions, and the machine dependent physical map layer is used as a cache
 * of that information.
 *
 * Most of the kernel clients never have to make VM maps themselves
 * and will instead interact with:
 * - the @c current_map() (or a given task map),
 * - the @c kernel_map (which is the kernel's own map) or one of its submaps.
