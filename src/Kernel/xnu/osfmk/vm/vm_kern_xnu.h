 * @typedef kmem_flags_t

 *
 * @discussion
 * This type is not used directly by any function, it is an underlying raw
 * type that is re-vended under different namespaces for each @c kmem_*
 * interface.
 *
 * - @c kmem_alloc    uses @c kma_flags_t / @c KMA_* namespaced values.
 * - @c kmem_suballoc uses @c kms_flags_t / @c KMS_* namespaced values.
 * - @c kmem_realloc  uses @c kmr_flags_t / @c KMR_* namespaced values.
 * - @c kmem_free     uses @c kmf_flags_t / @c KMF_* napespaced values.
 *
 *
 * <h2>Call behavior</h2>
 *
 * @const KMEM_NONE (all)
 *	Pass this when no special options is to be used.
 *
 * @const KMEM_NOFAIL (alloc, suballoc)
 *	When this flag is passed, any allocation failure results into a panic().
 *	Using this flag should really be limited to cases when failure is not
 *	recoverable and possibly during early boot only.
 *
 * @const KMEM_NOPAGEWAIT (alloc, realloc)
 *	Pass this flag if the system should not wait in VM_PAGE_WAIT().
 *
 * @const KMEM_FREEOLD (realloc)
 *	Pass this flag if @c kmem_realloc should free the old mapping
 *	(when the address changed) as part of the call.
 *
 * @const KMEM_REALLOCF (realloc)
 *	Similar to @c Z_REALLOCF: if the call is failing,
 *	then free the old allocation too.
 *
 * @const KMEM_NOSOFTLIMIT (alloc, realloc)
 *  Kernel private.
 *  Override soft allocation size limits and attempt to make the allocation
 *  anyways.
 *
 * <h2>How the entry is populated</h2>
 *
 * @const KMEM_VAONLY (alloc)
 *	By default memory allocated by the kmem subsystem is wired and mapped.
 *	Passing @c KMEM_VAONLY will cause the range to still be wired,
 *	but no page is actually mapped.
 *
 * @const KMEM_PAGEABLE (alloc)
 *	By default memory allocated by the kmem subsystem is wired and mapped.
 *	Passing @c KMEM_PAGEABLE makes the entry non wired, and pages will be
 *	added to the entry as it faults.
 *
 * @const KMEM_ZERO (alloc, realloc)
 *	Any new page added is zeroed.
 *
 *
 * <h2>VM object to use for the entry</h2>
 *
 * @const KMEM_KOBJECT (alloc, realloc)
 *	The entry will be made for the @c kernel_object.
 *
 *	Note that the @c kernel_object is just a "collection of pages".
 *	Pages in that object can't be remaped or present in several VM maps
 *	like traditional objects.
 *
 *	If neither @c KMEM_KOBJECT nor @c KMEM_COMPRESSOR is passed,
 *	the a new fresh VM object will be made for this allocation.
 *	This is expensive and should be limited to allocations that
 *	need the features associated with a VM object.
 *
 * @const KMEM_COMPRESSOR (alloc)
 *	The entry is allocated for the @c compressor_object.
 *	Pages belonging to the compressor are not on the paging queues,
 *	nor are they counted as wired.
 *
 *	Only the VM Compressor subsystem should use this.
 *
 *
 * <h2>How to look for addresses</h2>
 *
 * @const KMEM_LOMEM (alloc, realloc)
 *	The physical memory allocated must be in the first 4G of memory,
 *	in order to support hardware controllers incapable of generating DMAs
 *	with more than 32bits of physical address.
 *
 * @const KMEM_LAST_FREE (alloc, suballoc, realloc)
 *	When looking for space in the specified map,
 *	start scanning for addresses from the end of the map
 *	rather than the start.
 *
 * @const KMEM_DATA (alloc, suballoc, realloc)
 *	The memory must be allocated from the "Data" range.
 *
 * @const KMEM_IO (alloc, suballoc, realloc)
 *	The memory must be allocated from the "IO" range.
 *
 * @const KMEM_GUESS_SIZE (free)
 *	When freeing an atomic entry (requires a valid kmem guard),
 *	then look up the entry size because the caller didn't
 *	preserve it.
 *
 *	This flag is only here in order to support kfree_data_addr(),
 *	and shall not be used by any other clients.
 *
 * <h2>Entry properties</h2>
 *
 * @const KMEM_PERMANENT (alloc, suballoc)
 *	The entry is made permanent.
 *
 *	In the kernel maps, permanent entries can never be deleted.
 *	Calling @c kmem_free() on such a range will panic.
 *
 *	In user maps, permanent entries will only be deleted
 *	whenthe map is terminated.
 *
 * @const KMEM_GUARD_FIRST (alloc, realloc, free)
 * @const KMEM_GUARD_LAST (alloc, realloc, free)
 *	Asks @c kmem_* to put a guard page at the beginning (resp. end)
 *	of the allocation.
 *
 *	The allocation size will not be extended to accomodate for guards,
 *	and the client of this interface must take them into account.
 *	Typically if a usable range of 3 pages is needed with both guards,
 *	then 5 pages must be asked.
 *
 *	Alignment constraints take guards into account (the aligment applies
 *	to the address right after the first guard page).
 *
 *	The returned address for allocation will pointing at the entry start,
 *	which is the address of the left guard page if any.
 *
 *	Note that if @c kmem_realloc* or @c kmem_free* is called, the *exact*
 *	same guard flags must be passed for this entry. The KMEM subsystem
 *	is generally oblivious to guards, and passing inconsistent flags
 *	will cause pages to be moved incorrectly.
 *
 * @const KMEM_KSTACK (alloc)
 *	This flag must be passed when the allocation is for kernel stacks.
 *	This only has an effect on Intel.
 *
 * @const KMEM_GUARD_STACK (alloc, realloc, free)
 *	Adds an additional fictitious guard page right after the first guard page.
 *	This is used for kernel stacks to allow for on-demand expansion of the
 *	guard region. Must be used with @c KMEM_GUARD_FIRST.
 *
 * @const KMEM_NOENCRYPT (alloc)
 *	Obsolete, will be repurposed soon.
 *
 * @const KMEM_KASAN_GUARD (alloc, realloc, free)
 *	Under KASAN_CLASSIC add guards left and right to this allocation
 *	in order to detect out of bounds.
 *
 *	This can't be passed if any of @c KMEM_GUARD_FIRST
 *	or @c KMEM_GUARD_LAST is used.
 *
 * @const KMEM_TAG (alloc, realloc, free)
 *	Under KASAN_TBI, this allocation is tagged non canonically.

 *
 *
 * @param map           map to allocate into, must be a kernel map.

 *                      passing 0 means @c kmem_alloc_guard() will be called.
 * @param oldsize       the current size of the entry
 * @param newsize       the new size of the entry,
 *                      0 means kmem_free_guard() will be called.

#pragma mark accounting: vm tags

/*
 * VM Tags come in 3 flavors:
 *
 * - static user VM tags, defined by the @c VM_MEMORY_* constants
 *   (@see <mach/vm_statistics.h>),
 *
 * - static kernel VM tags, defined by the @c VM_KERN_MEMORY_* constants
 *   (@see <mach/vm_statistics.h>),
 *
 * - dynamically allocated kernel VM tags typically associated with kexts
 *   lazily (as kexts wire down memory and accounting needs to be made).
 *
 * By default, kernel VM tags track wired memory at the VM layer,
 * but no insight is given to allocations done by @c kalloc*()
 * and its wrappers like @c IOMalloc*(), when backed by zone memory
 * (for sizes below @c KHEAP_MAX_SIZE).
 *
 *
 * Implementation details
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * Static tags are limited to values from 0 to 255, as they are passed
 * in the bits reserved by the @c VM_FLAGS_ALIAS_MASK of VM flags.
 *
 * However, dynamic flags are an internal kernel concept which is limited
 * by the size of the storage in VM map entries, which reserves
 * @c VME_ALIAS_BITS (12) for this, effectively limiting dynamic
 * tags to about 4000.
 *
 * @c [VM_KERN_MEMORY_FIRST_DYNAMIC, VM_MAX_TAG_VALUE) defines the range of
 * possible values for dynamic tags.
 *
 *
 * Zone accounting [development kernels]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * On development kernels the "-zt" boot-arg can be used, in which case
 * precise accounting of @c kalloc*() allocations is enabled per bucket,
 * which can be observed by the @c zprint(1) command.
 *
 * This effectively makes accounting a vector composed of @c VM_TAG_SIZECLASSES
 * possible zone size classes in addition to the regular VM wired memory
 * accounting that is always performed.
 *
 * The tag for which an allocation is recorded will be (in first hit order):
 *
 * - the tag specified as part of the @c zalloc_flags_t explicitly
 *   (@see @c kalloc_*_tag() or @c Z_VM_TAG()). In core XNU, non @c _tag
 *   variants of @c kalloc*() will generate a per-call site dynamic VM tag,
 *   using the @c VM_ALLOC_SITE_TAG() macro,
 *
 * - if the allocation was made by a kernel extension, the dynamic VM tag
 *   for this extension (@see @c vm_tag_bt()),
 *
 * - as a fallback:
 *     o @c VM_KERN_MEMORY_KALLOC_DATA for @c kalloc_data() calls,
 *     o @c VM_KERN_MEMORY_KALLOC_TYPE for @c kalloc_type() calls,
 *     o @c VM_KERN_MEMORY_KALLOC for legacy @c kalloc() calls.
