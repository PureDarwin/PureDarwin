/*
 * os_refcnt reference counting API
 *
 * Two flavors are provided: atomic and locked. Atomic internally uses C11 atomic
 * operations and requires no external synchronization, whereas the locked flavor
 * assumes the refcnt object is locked by the caller. It is NOT safe to
 * mix-and-match locked and atomic calls.
 *
 * 'refgrp's are a way to (hierarchically) group like refcount objects for
 * debugging purposes. The group keeps track of the total number and aggregate
 * reference count of member refcounts, and the "rlog=" boot-arg is used to enable
 * refcount logging by group name. Named groups can be created explicitly with
 * os_refgrp_decl(), or implicitly by passing NULL for the refgrp when
 * initializing a refcnt object. In the latter case, the group name is the same as
 * the function enclosing the init call. Groups are only available on DEV or DEBUG
 * builds, and are otherwise compiled out.

 * removed.
